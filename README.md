# LogViewer
LogViewer is a simple tool to help you analyze Android logs.
It allows you to analyze multiple log files at once and create (and apply) different filters on this set of log files as if they were only one.

* **Drag and drop (or open) multiple log files at once** - All the log files will be correctly arranged in chronological order and presented in a single view
* **Create multiple filters and differentiate them by color** - When one or more filters are applied, the *filtered* result is presented to you in a "filtered view" so you can see only the content that matters to you
* **Reorder your filters according to your needs** - Simply drag and drop the filters to arrange them to your taste.
* **Save your filters for later use** - Save your filters to disk so it is easy to just start using it next time, without worrying about creating them over and over again
* **Use regular expressions to create your filters** - You can create simple filters or complex filters. It is up to you, any regex pattern is possible
