# About Log Viewer
LogViewer is an easy-to-use tool intended to help with the analysis of Android logs.

With Log Viewer, you can open multiple log files at once and it will present you a single merged output containing all the logs already ordered by timestamp. This is very useful when you have different files for _'main'_, _'system'_ and _'radio'_ logs, for example. Or simply if your logs are broken down in multiple files.

It also allows you to apply different filters on the set of logs, displaying a single filtered output, differentiating each filter by color. Filters can be as simple as a single word, or as complex as you want using regex.
