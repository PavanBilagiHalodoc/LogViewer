![Log Viewer](images/MainWindow.png)
### 1 - Menu
* **File**
  - Here you can access and change user preferences or open a new Log Viewer window (Very useful when you need to compare 2 or more set of logs)
* **Logs**
  - Here is one of the places you can open the logs (You can also simply drag and drop the log files inside the Log Viewer Window)
* **Filter**
  - This is where you can open or save your filters (This is very useful since you won't have to define all filters over and over again every time you use Log Viewer)
* **Help**
  - Here you can find a link to this page and an 'About' dialog

### 2 - Logs location
When you open a set of logs to be analyzed using Log Viewer, often times it is very useful to compare different logs (using multiple Log Viewer windows), for example to compare 'failure' and 'success' logs. This allows you to differentiate each of these Windows by showing the location of the logs that are being analyzed on each window.

### 3 - Filters list
This is where all the created filters will be displayed. (Use '+' button to create a new one, and 'apply' to apply all the selected filters to the set of logs. Also, you can drag and drop flters to re-order them, and delete by using the delete key on the selected filters)

### 4 - All Logs
This is where your logs will be displayed, merged and in a chronological order

### 5 - Filtered Logs
When one or more log filters are applied, this is where the filtered logs will be presented
